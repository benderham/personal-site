## The Boilerplate

So, you need a starting point that doesn't require you to spend an eternity deleting the crap you don't need? Well this is it, a simple SASS structure built on Bourbon and Neat (oh and a few cool mixins), a single HTML file and a place to work your JS wizardry.

This is designed to run on Codekit, download, drag and drop, Go!
